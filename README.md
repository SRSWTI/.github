# srswti

building world's fastest retrieval & inference algorithms

## about us

srswti research labs is focused on pushing the boundaries of computing through open-source research and development. we empower millions of researchers and students to build their own projects, creating more efficient engineering systems and infrastructures that push humanity forward.

## our pillars

### research labs
developing cutting-edge algorithms for retrieval and inference at unprecedented speeds.

### open source initiative
our open-source research has become foundational for countless projects worldwide, enabling innovation in ai, machine learning, and distributed systems.

## open source projects

### [ssr: srswti symbolic reasoner](https://www.srswti.com)
an open-source tool for symbolic regression, a machine learning approach focused on finding simple, symbolic expressions that best fit a given objective.

*coming easter 2026*

### [fasterpc](https://www.srswti.com)
rpc over websockets made easy, robust, and production ready. a fast and durable bidirectional json rpc channel over websockets. the easiest way to create a live async channel between two nodes via python (or other clients - works with docker, node.js, ruby on rails, and any other platform).

### [fckprint](https://www.srswti.com)
a powerful debugging and monitoring library that provides comprehensive tracing, performance monitoring, error tracking, caching, and production-ready features.

### [shadows](https://www.srswti.com)
a lightning-fast distributed background task processing framework with one-way background task processing devoid of unnecessary complexity. seamless scheduling of immediate or future workloads. bypass problematic tasks or parameters without requiring code redeployment.

### [axis](https://www.srswti.com)
srswti-axis (ai explainable inference & search) is an industry-ready machine learning library for advanced data retrieval and interpretable ai solutions.
